# Propane Routing Application

The initial plan for this application was to take sensors placed on propane
tanks, display the information for specific vendors, and provide routing to low
tanks based off of Google Maps.

Frontend is written in Elm, with Javascript ports to work with Google Maps' API.
Backend is written in Haskell, using the Servant library.
